## 4. Writing Tips

1. **Write for the new hire**: Assume zero context
2. **Be specific**: "Click the blue Submit button" not "Submit the form"
3. **One action per step**: Don't combine multiple actions
4. **Include decision points**: What if something goes wrong?
5. **Add screenshots**: For complex UIs or dashboards
6. **Test it**: Have someone else follow it without help

| **Read** | Reference existing processes |

---

## 6. Boundaries

**Will Not:**
- Observe actual processes (you describe, AI documents)
- Automate the processes themselves
- Replace training (SOPs supplement, not replace)
